Usage

* Running Plugin

  The following will run the main goal of the plugin from the command line:

+-----
mvn ${project.groupId}:classpath:classpath
+-----

  or a shorter version:

+-----
mvn classpath:classpath
+-----

  For running the goals of the plugin in a shorter version,
  your Maven configuration file (~/.m2/settings.xml)
  must contain the following lines:

+-----
<pluginGroups>
    <pluginGroup>${project.groupId}</pluginGroup>
</pluginGroups>
+-----

  It should be noted that the run of <<classpath>> goal of this plugin separately
  from the other phases of the Maven lifecycle will not bring
  any expected changes in the project, because plugin focuses
  on use in the conjunction with the other phases.

  In other words, the use of this plugin is recommended in
  <<generate-resources>> phase, which precedes the phase <<compile>>.
  Plugin configuration for such use are presented in the next paragraph:

* Configuring Plugin

  Below shows a template of plugin configuration for use on stage,
  corresponding the phase <<generate-resources>>, with indication of
  available configuration options (in a boolean parameters specify default values):

<project>
    ...
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
                <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
                <version>${project.version}</version>

                        <goals>

                                ...
                            </paths>
                            <isMask>true</isMask>
                            <withSubDir>false</withSubDir>
                            <assignProjectClasspath>true</assignProjectClasspath>
                            <overlapDependencyMatch>false</overlapDependencyMatch>
                            <outputFile>...</outputFile>

                            <errorIsEmptyPath>false</errorIsEmptyPath>
                        </configuration>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>

    </build>
